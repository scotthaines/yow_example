<h2>Key ideas</h2>
<ol>
  <li>HTML static browser pages 
    <p>Hyperlinks make writing better. Don't write just for print on paper.
    Write static HTML browser pages. They're easy to create. Technical,
    academic, business, government and institutional writing improves with
    hyperlinks.</p>
    <p>The main place where hyperlinks don't help are creative works like
    stories where you want to control the reader's path from beginning to
    end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>wikipedia 
    <p>Three ideas from wikipedia are</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cite your sources.</li>
      <li>Make clear what are internal links and what are external links.</li>
      <li>Improve the content over time. This can be done by a group or an
        individual.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) 
    <p>Three ideas broadly taken from the FOSS movement are</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Think about how you want your work used.</li>
      <li>Make the legal statements on your work reflect how you want your work
        used. 
        <p>FOSS and the Creative Commons licenses which extend libre and open
        licenses into writing and creations other than text are all about
        getting the legal part regarding your work to do what you want. These
        licenses also happen to emphasize openness and liberty in the use. Your
        choices may be a free/libre license or a very proprietary use like a
        business trade secret or confidential information, or government
        classified information. Your use may be something in between like the
        copyright and use typical of books (you can read the book; share the
        book or resell the book but you cannot copy the book and you especially
        cannot copy the book and sell the copies). In any case make the legal
        statements on your work reflect how you want it used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Use other works according to their legal use statements. 
        <p>If you put carefully state how others are to use your work you might
        be more inclined to follow use statements of works.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>version control 
    <p>Use version control software to manage changes in the browser pages.
    Keep track of who changed what, when they did it and their explanations of
    why they made the changes. Also create and keep branch variations. These
    variations can be experiments or derivative works.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
