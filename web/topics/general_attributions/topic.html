<h2>General attributions</h2>

<p>These general attributions for OOW Example are of two kinds. The first are
the key ideas that inspire and inform OOW Example. The second are content from
other sources which spread across Our Own Web (OOW) Example. This content and
these ideas from other sources are not just on specific pages but span many or
all OOW Example pages.</p>

<p>key ideas:</p>
<ol>
  <li>HTML static browser pages
    <p>Technical, academic, business, government and institutional writing is
    better with hyper links. Static browser pages are easy to create so write
    HTML browser pages rather than pages for print on paper. The main exception
    to writing HTML browser pages I see are creative works like stories where
    you want to control the reader's path from beginning to end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>wikipedia
    <p>Three ideas taken from wikipedia are</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cite your sources.</li>
      <li>Make clear what are internal links and what are external links.</li>
      <li>Improve the content. This can be done by a group or by an individual
        over time.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
    <p>Three ideas taken broadly taken from the FOSS movement are</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Think about how you want your work used.</li>
      <li>Make the legal statements on your work reflect how you want your work
        used.
        <p>FOSS and the Creative Commons licenses which extend libre and open
        licenses into writing and creations other than text are all about
        getting the legal part regarding your work to do what you want. These
        licenses also happen to emphasize openness and liberty in the use. Your
        choices may be a free/libre license or a very proprietary use like a
        business trade secret or confidential information, or government
        classified information. Your use may be something in between like the
        copyright and use typical of books (you can read the book; share the
        book or resell the book but you cannot copy the book and you especially
        cannot copy the book and sell the copies). In any case make the legal
        statements on your work reflect how you want it used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Use other works according to thier legal use statements.
        <p>If you put care into stating how others are to use your work you
        might be more likely to follow the use statements of others regarding
        their works.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>version control</li>
  <li>search</li>
</ol>
