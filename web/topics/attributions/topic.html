<h2>Attributions</h2>

<p>Attribution acknowledges the work of another.<sub>[1]</sub> Good attribution
has several parts. These are</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indicate what is from another source.</li>
  <li>title (Provide the title or description of what is from another
  source.)</li>
  <li>author (Who created it.)</li>
  <li>source (Where can you get it.)</li>
  <li>license (Under what terms is this work provided.)</li>
  <li>changes (If the work included is modified from the original, a derivative
    work, then describe the changes.)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#YOW_Example_Attributions">YOW Example Attributions</a> are
provided for several reasons. These include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some items included in YOW Example require attribution. These items from
    other sources have licenses or terms of use which require their attribution
    if they are included in another work. The CC BY 4.0 License Deed is an
    example. The Deed's attribution<a href="#ai"><sub>[ai]</sub></a> is
    required since <a href="../cc_by_4.0/topic.html">the deed</a> is explicitly
    included in YOW Example.<sub>[2]</sub></li>
  <li>It is the right thing to do. "It is widely regarded as a sign of decency
    and respect to acknowledge the creator by giving him/her credit for the
    work."<sub>[3]</sub></li>
  <li>Attributions in YOW Example serve as an example. If you write something
    from scratch then fill in a section like '<a href="#Attributio"><em>"Your
    work's title"</em> Attributions</a>'. If you write something and include
    pages from YOW Example then both fill in a section like '<a
    href="#Attributio"><em>"Your work's title"</em> Attributions</a>' where you
    will attribute YOW Example and other works as necessary, and include the
    parts of '<a href="#YOW_Example_Attributions">YOW Example Attributions</a>'
    for what you included from YOW Example which in turn is from other
  sources.</li>
  <li>"Attribution ... allows an author to accumulate a positive reputation
    that partially repays their work".<sub>[4]</sub></li>

  <li>The Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files styles.css, styles_narrow.css and
    print.css used throughout YOW Example are based on the one column fixed
    width, centered example from Max Design, <a
    href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/css-layouts/">http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/css-layouts/</a> 
    <p>For what amounts to the license or terms of use Max Design states, "Here
    are a range of free CSS page layouts," ..."free to use and abuse as
    needed." Retrieved 2014 12 06</p>
    <p>The .css files have several changes from the Max Design .css file.
    Changes include the width and the background images in the header and
    footer. The width was changed to fit the now low common monitor width of
    1024 pixels. The background images in the header and footer create a very
    simple style which also prints well without color.</p>
