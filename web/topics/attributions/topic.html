<h2>Attributions</h2>

<p>Attributions give credit where credit is due. An <a
href="../attribution_described/topic.html">attribution describes</a> what is
from another source, describes your modifications if any and mentions its
license or terms of use which presumably allows you to include it.</p>

<p>If you include part or all of YOW Example in a work of yours then include
this page with the '"Your work's title" Attributions' section filled in. Also
keep the 'YOW Example Attributions' entries which still apply to your work.</p>

  <li>The Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files styles.css, styles_narrow.css and
    print.css used throughout these pages are based on the one column fixed

    <p>The .css files have several changes from the Max Design .css file.
    Changes include the width and the background images in the header and
    footer. The width was changed to fit the now low common monitor width of
    1024 pixels. The background images in the header and footer create a very
    simple style which also prints well without color.</p>
