<h2>Use</h2>

<p>To write, maintain and improve your own web of linked browser pages is easy
but you need a few things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>resources
    <p></p>
    <p>Never start a browser page from scratch. YOW Free Sample (YFS) is a
    collection of well constructed browser pages. Copy and modify YFS pages to
    create your pages.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Install YOW Free Sample two or more times on your computer. First
    install your reference copy. Do not change this. It is your reference on
    your computer. Keep it. Look at it. Copy pages from it.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Next install YOW Free Sample to a folder for your pages. Edit, copy and
    delete pages in this install. Turn these pages into your pages. You repeat
    this for each separate web of pages you create.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Depending on how you like to work another install of YOW Free Sample can
    be a test "sandbox". Make changes here to learn. These pages are not for
    keeping or presentation.</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>tools
    <p></p>
    <p>Amaya, Git and Tortoise Git are the tools.</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>knowledge 
    <p></p>
    <p>Learn to edit and write HTML pages and simple CSS files with Amaya.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Learn how to keep and use a history of changes to your pages. Tortoise
    Git makes this use of Git quick to start and learn.</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>organization
    <p></p>
    <p>YFS provides organization at several levels.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Each page is rather plain HTML. Plain is good. It is not so hard to
        understand when you look at it in a text editor.</li>
      <li>YFS pages have a common format generally kept in CSS files.</li>
      <li>YFS pages are various kinds of pages like lists, calendars, pages
        with pictures and pages with slide shows.</li>
      <li>The hard bits like how to sort a list or run a slide show are in
        Javascript libraries you use but do not edit or change.</li>
      <li>Page to page YFS is an index page with topics pages. These pages have
        relative links between them.</li>
      <li>The YFS page change history is a Git repository installed with
      YFS.</li>
      <li>Your change history starts when you commit your changes to the Git
        repository.</li>
      <li>By cloning Git repositories and push and pulling changes between the
        repositories you can have your pages on several computers for editing,
        viewing, publishing and backup. </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>None of this organization provided by YFS uses or requires servers. This
    makes installing YFS easier primarily by not providing support for
    controlled access (login support), private communcation (login passwords
    for example) or database support (dynamic data, weather information or
    purchase information for example). You can still potentially have these
    items for your pages but they must be provided by something in addition to
    YFS.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Edit your copy of YOW Free Sample pages with <a
href="../amaya/topic.html">Amaya</a> to make the pages your own. Use Git with
Tortoise Git to keep a history of your changes.</p>

<p><a href="../hello_git/topic.html">Hello Git</a> is a quick example of using
Git with Tortoise Git. If you still need to be convinced that version control
with Git is helpful read <a href="../git_for_you/topic.html">Git for
you</a>.</p>
